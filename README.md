# # February Code Jam

This Code Jam is dedicated to Valentineâ€™s Day! 

Some people love this holiday because it gives them a chance to express their feelings, get closer with their loved ones, or even confess their romantic feelings. Some people hate/ignore this holiday for various reasons, such as it being too fixed on romantic relationships or for serving as an occasion to buy useless stuff that pollutes the planet. 

Our webpage helps people create Valentine's cards and send them to their beloved ones. Our drag-and-drop interface allows creating original products with personal touch.
